              <p>Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently
                have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders
                involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within
                minutes (panic attacks).</p>

              <p>These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of
                proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent
                these feelings.</p>

      <!-- #INFORMATION -->

        <div class="container">
          <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
          <p>If you experience the following, it's important to see a doctor:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships, or other parts
              of your life</li>
            <li>Your fear, worry, or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control</li>
            <li>You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with
              anxiety</li>
            <li>You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem</li>
            <li>You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Causes</h2>
          <p>The causes of anxiety disorders aren't fully understood. Life experiences such as traumatic events appear to
            trigger anxiety disorders in people who are already prone to anxiety. Inherited traits also can be a factor.</p>

          <h3>Risk factors</h3>
          <p>These factors may increase your risk of developing an anxiety disorder:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Trauma:</strong> Children who endured abuse or trauma or witnessed traumatic events are at higher
              risk of developing an anxiety disorder at some point in life.</li>
            <li><strong>Stress due to an illness:</strong> Having a health condition or serious illness can cause
              significant worry about issues such as your treatment and your future.</li>
            <!-- Add more risk factors as needed -->
          </ul>

          <h2>Complications</h2>
          <p>Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and
            physical conditions, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Depression (which often occurs with an anxiety disorder) or other mental health disorders</li>
            <li>Substance misuse</li>
            <li>Trouble sleeping (insomnia)</li>
            <li>Digestive or bowel problems</li>
            <li>Headaches and chronic pain</li>
            <li>Social isolation</li>
            <li>Problems functioning at school or work</li>
            <li>Poor quality of life</li>
            <li>Suicide</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Prevention</h2>
          <p>There's no way to predict for certain what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take
            steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Get help early. Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.</li>
            <li>Stay active. Participate in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. Enjoy
              social interaction and caring relationships, which can lessen your worries.</li>
            <li>Avoid alcohol or drug use. Alcohol and drug use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of
              these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a
              support group to help you.</li>
